Context: ['Well name: 16/10-5; Source: Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD); General: Well 16/10-5 was drilled on the Isbjorn prospect in the northern end of the Jaeren High in the North Sea. The Isbjorn Prospect was mapped as a four-way dip-closure structure. The primary objective of the well was to test the hydrocarbon potential in the Late Jurassic Ula Formation sandstones.; Operations and results: Well 16/10-5 was spudded with the jack-up installation Maersk Giant on 6 October 2012 and drilled to TD at 3034 m in the Middle Jurassic Bryne Formation. A 12 1/2” pilot hole was drilled from below the 30” conductor to 1057 m to check for shallow gas. No shallow gas was seen. Drilling of the 8-1/2” section was troubled with junk in the hole ending up with two additional clean-out runs; else, operations proceeded without significant problem. The well was drilled with seawater and sweeps down to 180 m, with KCl/GEM/Polymer mud from 180 m to 1057 m, and with Enviromul oil based mud from 1057 m to TD.The well penetrated 98 m of radioactive Mandal Formation shales directly overlying the Ula Formation. The Ula formation came in at 2929 m, which was 65 m shallower than the prognosis. One hundred and six m of good quality sand was penetrated but it was water filled without shows and gas values were low. RCI pressure data points indicate a common formation water gradient, with no likely internal pressure barriers, for both Ula and Bryne Formations.No conventional or sidewall cores were taken. The RCI tool was run for pressure points, but no fluid samples were taken.

No significant problem was encountered in the operations. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 601 m and with Aquadril mud from 601 m to TD.The well penetrated a thick sequence consisting of alluvial deposits of predominantly Middle-Early Triassic age with top at 1936 m. The alluvial deposits show in general poor reservoir quality although a 25 m interval with improved quality is seen close to TD. The cored section is strongly fractured and appears to have penetrated several fault zones. The sandstones are partly filled with heavy biodegraded oil; however, in the upper part the section was too tight to establish a pressure gradient. The reservoir pressure in the water zone is close to hydrostatic pressure, 4 bar above the Luno II discovery well 16/4-6 S, indicating a barrier between these two wells.Six cores were cut in succession from 1937 to 1983.8 m, covering the Triassic to Early Cretaceous (Sola Fm) unconformity in the well and the upper 45 m of the Hegre Group.

Context: ['Well name: 1/2-1; Source: Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD); General: Well 1/2-1 is located in the Central Graben, about 200 m from the UK border in the North Sea. The main objective was Paleocene sands of the Rogaland Group. The secondary target was the chalk formations, although these were possibly not enough fractured to represent a reservoir.; Operations and results: Wildcat well 1/2-1 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Ross Isle on 20 March 1989 and drilled to TD at 3574 m in the Late Cretaceous Tor Formation. While cutting of core no 7, the elevators accidentally opened and dropped the string. Two attempts were made to recover the string with no success. The hole was sidetracked from 3078.5 m and core no 8 was cut. The well was drilled with seawater down to 645 m, with native mud (water mixed with clays from the borehole itself) from 645 m to1525 m, and with seawater from 1525 m to TD. No shallow gas was detected in the hole.The Forties Formation came in at 3121 m. The formation was hydrocarbon bearing down to 3142.5 m as confirmed by both electric logs and the RFT pressure gradient. The reservoir sandstones of the Forties Formation showed good to excellent reservoir properties. Average core porosity was 18.5% and test permeability was measured to 49 mD.Shows on cores were recorded down to core # 8 where they gradually decreased to zero at 3166 m. From the RFT data two water gradients were identified below the oil zone. A shift of 8 psi between them suggested the existence of an impermeable barrier around 3160.2 and 3162 m. Core saturations and fluorescence indicated the potential existence of a thin (4 m) oil zone below this barrier. This zone was not identified from the logs and was not evaluated for a test due to lack of data at that point.The Ekofisk formation was encountered at 3407 m, and the Tor formation at 3514 m. Both formations were water bearing.A total of 8 cores were cut in the', 'Well name: 2/1-1; Source: Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD); General: Well 2/1-1 was drilled on the Cod Terrace on the eastern margin of the Central Graben of the North Sea. The objectives were Danian - Late Cretaceous limestones and possible Jurassic sandstone.; Operations and results: Wildcat well 2/1-1 was spudded with the jack-up installation Ocean Tide on 28 August 1972 and drilled to TD at 4178 m in sediments believed to be of Late Jurassic age. The hole was drilled without much problem down to TD in the 8 1/2" section at 3886 m where logs were run and a 7" liner was set with shoe at 3885 m. A 5 7/8" hole was drilled to 4178 (TD) where the well kicked and the pipe got stuck. During killing operations returns were lost and circulation could not be re-established. The kick was most likely caused by a salt water flow from a Late Jurassic sand lense. When trying to back off the drill pipe twisted off, leaving a 340 m fish in the hole. A cement retainer was set and the well was plugged back to 3789 m. Hence, no logs were run below 3886 m.Oil shows (dull gold fluorescence with slow straw-yellow cut) were observed in the shales at the base of the Middle Palaeocene and at the top of the Danian limestone (3124 - 3178 m), especially at 3161 m where there was a good straw-yellow streaming cut (faster than the upper intervals) accompanied by a minor gas peak. In the lower part of the Maastrichtian limestone gas peaks with 10% C2+ components appeared. Oil shows were recorded in limestone horizons in the Campanian and in the Berriasian. Weak fluorescence was observed also in thin sandstone lenses in the Late Jurassic, above the kick-sand at TD.A core was cut from 3165.3 to 3179.1 m (10385 to 10430 ft) in the Danian limestone (Ekofisk Formation).The well was permanently abandoned on 14 November 1972 as a well with shows.', "Well name: 1/2-1; Source: Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD); Coordinates: 2° 28' 35.7'' E56° 53' 15.07'' N; Oldest penetrated age: CAMPANIAN; Oldest penetrated formation: TOR FM; Drilling days: 0        77\n1        51\n2       129\n3        75\n4       215\n       ... \n2042     78\n2043     29\n2044     16\n2045     34\n2046     24\nName: Drilling days, Length: 2047, dtype: int64; Drilling operator: Phillips Petroleum Norsk AS; Production licence: 143; Bottom hole temperature [°C]: 147", "Well name: 2/2-1; Source: Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD); Coordinates: 3° 38' 15.62'' E56° 47' 15.69'' N; Oldest penetrated age: LATE PERMIAN; Oldest penetrated formation: ZECHSTEIN GP; Drilling days: 0        77\n1        51\n2       129\n3        75\n4       215\n       ... \n2042     78\n2043     29\n2044     16\n2045     34\n2046     24\nName: Drilling days, Length: 2047, dtype: int64; Drilling operator: Saga Petroleum ASA; Production licence: 066; Bottom hole temperature [°C]: 146", 'Well name: 2/2-1; Source: Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD); General: Well 2/2-1 was a wildcat drilled on a salt-induced dome structure in the SE corner of block 2/2.

Context: ['Well name: 2/6-3; Source: Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD); General: Well 2/6-3 is located on the north western flank of the Mandal High between the Sogne Basin and the Central Graben in the North Sea.It was drilled to test possible hydrocarbon accumulations in Late and Middle Jurassic sandstones. A third objective was to reconnoitre below base Permian.; Operations and results: Wildcat well 2/6-3 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Byford Dolphin on 9 November 1982 and drilled to TD at 4060 m, 270 meter into pre-Late Devonian basement rock. Technical problems occurred in the 12 1/4" section due to twist-off of Kelly saver, loss of 2700 m logging cable in hole, and 9 5/8" casing hanger collapse, causing a total of 203 hrs lost time. In the 8 1/2" section an anchor chain parted during a storm and four days were lost waiting on weather and re-anchoring. The well was drilled with water based mud.In the Late Jurassic only marine shales were encountered. At 3545 m, 200 m higher than prognosed a Middle Jurassic, fluvial sandstone of Bajocian age (Bryne Formation) was found water bearing. A sequence of anhydrite, dolomite and pure anhydrite was found below the Triassic red-shales, but no salt or Rotliegendes reservoir rocks were encountered. The Permian anhydrite was followed by a series of slated shales and phyllitic rocks, getting progressively more and more deformed, and with an introduction of metamorphism towards TD. Rb-Sr dating on 1-micron fraction material from 3875 m gave an age of 376 Ma in the Late Devonian. No oil shows were reported from the well. Background gas was recorded down to top Permian. No gas was recorded below top Permian.Three cores were cut. K1was cut at 3551 - 3560 m in Bryne Formation sandstone with 85% recovery.

The well was permanently abandoned as a junk well after drilling of 24/6-4 was completed.', 'Well name: 6507/2-3; Source: Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD); General: The primary objectives of the well were to test the hydrocarbon potential of the Lysing and Intra Lange Formations and further to test the reservoir quality and reservoir potential of a prospect lead in the Lyr Formation.; Operations and results: Well 6507/2-3 was spudded on 14th of March 1994, and reached a total depth of 3972 m RKB in the lowermost part of the Spekk Formation, on 22nd of April 1994. Water based mud was used with Spud mud to 1465 m RKB, "ANCO 2000" from there to 3141 m, and KCl/polymer from there to TD. The primary target, the Lysing Formation, was encountered from 2850m to 2891m RKB, and was water bearing. It consisted of a fairly massive sandstone sequence. The secondary target, the Intra Lange Formation sandstone interval at 3250.5 -3281m RKB, comprised a heterogeneous reservoir with very poor reservoir properties and residual oil. Two RFT runs were performed; one each in the Lysing and Lange Fm. A successful fluid sample was taken at 2852.6 m in the Lysing Fm. In the Lange Fm. a fluid sample was attempted and finally aborted due to low reservoir permeability. No reservoir was penetrated in the Lyr Fm. Two cores were cut from 2850 to 2891 m in the Lysing Formation and one from 3254 to 3264 m in the Lange Formation.

The primary objective was appraisal of reservoir development in the western part of the Albuskjell field. A Danian - Maastrichtian gas condensate field had previously been confirmed by two wells (A/S Norske Shell l/6-l and Phillips 2/4-9) drilled farther east along the WNW - ESE trending structure. Secondary objectives were to investigate Danian Chalk prospect and possible deeper prospects.; Operations and results: Appraisal well 1/6-3 was spudded with the jack-up installation Zapata Nordic on 12 April 1974. Three sidetracks had finally to be drilled, of which the second and deepest reached 3343 m in the Late Cretaceous Tor Formation. The first sidetrack was kicked off at 314 m after unsuccessful fishing (lost hole opener). The second sidetrack was kicked off at 3022 m when it was realised that a core point had been missed so that a Danian porous zone and 37 m of Maastrichtian had not been cored. Lost circulation and stuck pipe led to the third side track, which was kicked off at 2995 m. Further lost circulation problems and the discovery that there was a break in the casing at 3140 m finally led to abandonment of the well without investigating the deeper prospects. The well was drilled with seawater down to 417 m, with shale-trol/lignosulphonate from 417 m to 1221 m, with shale-trol/lignosulphonate and lime from 1221 m to 2500 m, and with lignosulphonate and lime from 2500 m to TD. A diesel/pipe lax pill was spotted at 314 m.As prognosed, gas was encountered both in the Danian and Late Maastrichtian Chalk. Hydrocarbons were present from Top Ekofisk at 3110 m down to an OWC at 3289.7 m in the Tor Formation. The net thicknesses were respectively 91 and 45 m. The great thickness of the Danian reservoir was in contrast to the findings from wells l/6-l and 2/4-9.']

Context: ['Well name: 33/2-1; Source: Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD); General: Well 33/2-1 was drilled to test the Storm prospect on the Manet Ridge in the northern North Sea. The well is located ca 4.5 km south of the 6201/11-1 discovery well. The primary objective of 33/2-1 was to test the reservoir properties and hydrocarbon potential of Late Jurassic Draupne sandstones, an equivalent to the Magnus Formation. The secondary objective was to test the reservoir properties and HC potential of the possible Eocene sandstones. The TD criterion was to drill to approximately 50 m into Triassic sediments, with planned TD at 4524 m.; Operations and results: Wildcat well 33/2-1 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Transocean Arctic on 7 October 2014 and drilled to TD at 4459 m in the Late Triassic Raude Formation. No significant problem was encountered in the operations. The well was drilled with seawater and viscous sweeps down to 483.5 m, with KCl/glycol mud from 483.5 m to 1422 m, with Performadril water based mud from 1422 m to 2008 m, and with oil based mud from 2208 m to TD.The primary and the secondary objectives were not encountered. The well proved hydrocarbons (gas/condensate) in non-commercial quantities in two zones in this well. The Early Cretaceous Mime Formation had one meter net pay with HC in the interval 3935 to 3952 m, while the Early Jurassic Eiriksson Formation had 2.6 meter net pay with HC in the interval 4387 to 4411 m. In addition, oil shows were described on cuttings in an Eocene sandstone at 1821 m and in the Lista Formation from 2031 to 2058 m. Oil shows were described also on sidewall cores from the interval 3867 to 4449 m. The oil shows below 2208 m are uncertain, possibly affected by OBM.No cores were cut. MDT fluid samples were taken at 3943 m (OBM filtrate) and 4409.6 m (oil with 62% mud filtrate contamination).

Bad weather with wind up to 31 m/s caused the rig to drift up to ca 40 feet off location on several occasions, interrupting drilling operations. The well was drilled with seawater and bentonite down to 463 m. A water based mud system was used in the remaining borehole.The well encountered gas in two zones in Oligocene. From log analyses most of the reservoir interval from 1623 m to 1636 m, except a shale break, had a porosity around 22% with Sw = 30%.á Best part of the second zone had a porosity of 23% with an Sw of 23%, (1597 m to 1600 m).

The site survey indicated two high amplitude events at two different levels west (135 m MSL) and northwest (180 m MSL) of the proposed well location that could indicate shallow gas.; Operations and results: Wildcat well 25/3-1 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation West Vanguard on 4 July 1989and drilled to TD at 3922 m in Late Triassic sediments of the Statfjord Formation. To assure safe operation in possible shallow gas zones, the interval (198 to 720 m) was drilled as a 17 1/2 " pilot hole before opening to 26" hole. Drilling went on without any serious problems. No shallow gas was encountered.The Vestland Group reservoir was reached 65 m deeper than expected. The reservoir was thinner than expected, and of relatively bad quality and water bearing. The Statfjord Formation was reached 128 m deeper than expected, and also water bearing. Very weak shows were recorded in two samples from 2165 m and 2170 m in the Balder Formation; otherwise no shows were recorded while drilling. Geochemical source rock screening found very good Type II kerogen (oil) source potential in the Draupne Formation and good Type II-III kerogen (gas + light oil) source potential in the Heather shales and the Vestland Group coals and shales.

RFT fluid samples from 4105 m recovered gas, condensate, water and mud filtrate.The well was permanently abandoned on 29 January 1982 as a gas/condensate discovery.; Testing: One drill stem test was performed from perforations in the interval 4064 to 4070 m. The test produced 478 Sm3 condensate and 617590 Sm3 gas /day through a 32/64" choke. The separator GOR was 1291 Sm3/Sm3, the condensate gravity was 41.3 °API, and the gas gravity was 0.679 (air = 1).', 'Well name: 30/7-8; Source: Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD); General: Well 30/7-8 was drilled in the Norwegian part of the Shetland Basin. The primary objective was to test the hydrocarbon potential in the Middle Jurassic Brent group, which had previously proved gas and condensate bearing in wells 30/4-2 and 30/7-6. The Early Jurassic Cook Formation and Statfjord Group were secondary targets. The planned TD was 4600 m in the Triassic Red Beds.; Operations and results: Appraisal well 30/7-8 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Treasure Seeker on 19 November 1980 and drilled to 4287 m in the Middle Jurassic Brent Group . The drill pipe became differentially stuck at 4069 m. After unsuccessful fishing, the well was suspended with top of the fish at 4058 m, and 4287 m became official TD for the well. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 215 m, with water based "lost circulation mud" from 215 m to 962 m, with gypsum/lignosulphonate mud from 962 m to 2648 m, with a bentonite/lignosulfonate/lignite mud type from 2648 m to TD.Frequent traces of oil shows were described in many intervals from 1820 m and down to well TD. Most of the shows occurred in limestone stringers and were rated poor. The primary target Middle Jurassic (Bathonian-Bajocian) Brent Group reservoir was encountered at 4066 m. The shows in the Brent Group sandstones were rated good.Five cores were cut in the well. One was cut in the Draupne Formation from 3888.5 m, while the other four were cut in the Brent Group reservoir section from 4082.3 m to 4129.3 m. No fluid sample was taken.', 'Well name: 30/9-8R; Source: Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD); General: Well 30/9-8 R was drilled on the Oseberg Omega structure, which is located between the Gamma structure to the east and the B structure to the west, and extends northwards into 079 license area. The main target of the well was sandstones in the Middle Jurassic Brent Group. The primary objectives were to prove the extension of the Omega oil column into license 104, find the fluid contacts, and test communication and reservoir relationship with the Omega North and B prospects. The well was planned to drill approximately 50 m into the Dunlin Group at a final depth of ca 3182 m RKB. Well 30/9-8 R is a re-entry of well 30/9-8, which was suspended at 1060 m while the rig left location temporary for another contract.; Operations and results: Wildcat well 30/9-8 was re-entered (30/9-8 R) by the semi-submersible rig Polar Pioneer on 15 August 1989. Cement and float collar was drilled from 1007 to 1060 m in 30/9-8. Well 30/9-8 R was then drilled to TD at 3200 m in the Early Jurassic Drake Formation. Drilling proceeded without significant problems. There was no indication of shallow gas. The well was drilled with a KCl/PAC/Polymer mud from 1060 m to TD.Top reservoir came in at 2814 m, approximately 30 m deeper than prognosed. The reservoir was oil bearing from 2824.5 to 2851 m. Below 2851 m the water saturation gradually increased. RFT data indicated a free water level at 2856 m (2832.5 m MSL). However, the available data do not permit the exact definition of the oil water contact, which is in the range 2856 -2862.5 m. The net pay was determined to be 22 m with average water saturation calculated to 46%. Average porosity was 18.5%. RFT results showed no pressure communication with well 30/9-4 within the Tarbert Formation. Well 30/9-8 is interpreted to be in communication with well 30/9-3a in the Tarbert oil zone but not with well 30/9-7.', 'Well name: 30/6-8; Source: Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD); General: Well 30/6-8 was drilled on the Epsilon structure between the Oseberg and Brage discoveries.

The primary objectives were to find hydrocarbon accumulations within the Brent Group and the overlying clastic wedge of Bathonian-Callovian age. Other Jurassic sandstones were also considered as prospective targets. The well was planned to reach ca 3500 m total depth, 75m into the Statfjord Group.; Operations and results: Wildcat well 30/6-8 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Treasure Seeker on 15 June 1982 and drilled to TD at 3600 m in the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation. A 17 1/2" pilot hole was drilled from 232 m to 950 m. No shallow gas was reported. No serious problems occurred while drilling. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 232 m, with seawater/hi-vis pills and Drispac from 232 m to 955 m, and with KCl/polymer mud from 955 m to TD.No hydrocarbon bearing sandstone intervals were encountered in this well. The only hydrocarbon indications were fluorescence and cut fluorescence in sandstone cuttings at 3560 to 3563 m in the Statfjord Group and trace fluorescence, no cut, in sidewall cores at 3147 and 3154 m in the Etive Formation.

Context: ['Well name: 16/2-21; Source: Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD); General: Well 16/2-21 was drilled to appraise the central part of the Johan Sverdrup discovery on the Utsira high in the North Seas. The hydrocarbon column height was predicted to be 14 m in the well location. The main objectives of the well were to investigate the reservoir sequence, facies and thickness in the central part of the discovery and to find the free water level (FWL).; Operations and results: Appraisal well 16/2-21 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Bredford Dolphin on 5 May 2013 and drilled to TD at 2070 m in the Late Triassic Skagerrak Formation. A 9 7/8" pilot hole was drilled from the seabed to 706 m due to slight shallow gas warnings. No shallow gas was seen. Drilling was efficient with little NPT. The NPT was caused mostly by mud losses in the Skagerrak Formation reservoir section. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 706 m and with Performadril water based mud from 76 m to TD.The top of the reservoir came in as prognosed at 1935 m, overlain by a 4 m thick Draupne Formation shale. An oil column of 12 meter entirely within the late Jurassic Intra-Draupne sandstones was proven. The well proved excellent development of these sandstones in the central part of the Johan Sverdrup discovery. The total thickness of the Intra-Draupne Formation sandstone was 12 m. No sediments of middle Jurassic age were found, but 17 m of water filled early Jurassic Eriksson Formation was encountered below the Draupne Formation. The well results show an oil water contact at 1947 m, but with residual oil saturations of 20-30% down to ca 1955 m.Above the reservoir, increasing amounts and wetness of mud gas down through the lowermost part of the Cromer Knoll Group suggested the possibility of leakage from the reservoir.

The main objective of the well was to prove commercial hydrocarbons in intra-Farsund Formation sandstone units.; Operations and results: Well 2/4-21 was spudded with the jack-up installation Maersk Gallant on 19 Jan.2012 and drilled to TD at 5395 m in the Late Jurassic Farsund Formation. No over-pressured shallow gas was seen, but a 2-3 m thick sand at 627 m contained normal-pressured gas with a composition consistent with a biogenic origin. The well was planned as an HPHT well with pressure prognosis based on results from the 2/4-18 well. Pressures proved to be even higher than prognosed and at 5029 m influx of gas occurred. The well was shut in and after several days control operations the mud was weighted up to 2.1 g/cm3 and drilling continued to TD. Well 2/4-21 was plugged back after having reached TD. All data acquisition was carried out in the main track, but it was decided to drill a parallel vertical sidetrack (2/4-21 T2) for the purpose of achieving good cores from the main reservoir level (the Farsund II sandstone).
